# Ultra Running Performance Prediction

## Overview
Using a race result dataset to predict finishing times for athletes

## Data
- Data sourced from scraping [DUV](https://statistik.d-u-v.org/)
- Code for scraping and cleaning https://github.com/Dusoye/DUVResults 

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning
   - Lots of useful features buried within strings, so extracting those
   - 

2. Feature Engineering


3. Exploratory Data Analysis

4. Model Development
   - Previously used Random Forests and XGBoost for Bob Graham round predictions https://github.com/Dusoye/BobGraham
   - Attempt to use Collabarative filtering 
   - Can also look at longitudinal models:
    - LSTM
    - GRU
    - XGBoost with time features
    - Transformers

5. Results


6. Conclusions and Future Work
